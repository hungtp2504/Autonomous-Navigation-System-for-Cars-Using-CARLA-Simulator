# Introduction
* **Project Overview**
     * The "Autonomous-Navigation-System-for-Car" project focuses on developing a self-driving system that integrates two key functionalities: automatic lane-keeping and obstacle detection. 
     * The system enables a vehicle to autonomously navigate while staying within lane boundaries and avoiding collisions with obstacles.

* **Objectives**
     * Implement an automatic navigation system that ensures the vehicle remains within its designated lane without causing lane invasions.
     * Develop an obstacle detection system capable of identifying and stopping the vehicle upon detecting objects within its path.

# Features
* **Automatic Lane Navigation:**
     * Generates and follows a random navigation route using semantic segmentation data.
     * Maintains the car's position within lanes using a deep learning-based steering angle prediction model.

* **Obstacle Detection:**
     * Utilizes LiDAR point cloud data to detect obstacles in the car's path.
     * Stops the car when obstacles are detected.

* **Deep Learning Integration:**
    * A neural network is trained on semantic segmentation images and navigation direction labels to predict steering angles.

# System Architecture
**The system consists of two main components:**
* **Perception Module:**
    * LiDAR sensor for obstacle detection.
    * Semantic segmentation camera for lane and navigation detection.

* **Control Module:**
    * A deep learning-based controller trained to predict the steering angle based on semantic images and navigation labels.
    * Speed control using a throttle-braking mechanism.


# Dataset Preparation
* **Semantic Segmentation Images**:
    * Generated using CARLA's semantic segmentation camera.
    * Images are labeled with steering angles and navigation directions.

# Implementation Details
* **Sensors Used:**
    * LiDAR: Detects obstacles and processes point cloud data.
    * Semantic Segmentation Camera: Captures road lanes and other objects in a segmented format.

* **Key Algorithms:**
    * Route Selection: Uses CARLA's GlobalRoutePlanner to generate navigation routes.
    * Obstacle Detection: Filters LiDAR points within a defined region of interest (ROI).

* **Control Logic:**
    * Predicted steering angles control the car's direction.
    * Throttle-braking logic maintains a preferred speed.

# Results
* **Steering Angle Prediction**:
    * Achieved smooth lane following with minimal deviations.

* **Obstacle Detection**:
    * Accurate detection of obstacles using LiDAR.
    * Immediate stopping when an obstacle is detected.
